# 👋 Hi, I'm Cindy  

## About Me  
I’m a Data Science & Economics student at Boston University (Class of 2026) who is passionate about applying machine learning and data analysis to challenges in **healthcare, sustainability, and policy**.  

As a first-generation student, I thrive on curiosity, adaptability, and problem-solving. Whether I’m building a machine learning pipeline, running econometric analysis, or organizing a WiDS datathon, I enjoy combining technical skills with purpose-driven work that creates impact.  

I’m especially fascinated by the role of AI in healthcare and data equity in clean energy transitions, and I love finding ways to bridge research with real-world applications.
